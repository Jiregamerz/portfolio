		<p>Here we will know about one such gamer Techno Gamerz who is earning millions of rupees per month just by playing video games. In today’s times, video games have become a major source of entertainment. You all should know about PUBG game, maybe you have played this game too.</p>
        <br> <p>
        After the introduction of PUBG mobile game, a new revolution has come in the game industry just as Jio 4g was in India. Today many gamers are earning crores just by playing PUBG and other games, like Dynamo, Mortal, Shroud, CartyMinati etc.

Techno Gamerz, his real name is Ujjwal Chaurasia, is a gamer and YouTuber by profession. You may know him for his content related to popular video games GTA 5 and Minecraft. However, he also occasionally posts content on PUBG, Free Fire, Clash of Clan and the other Battle Royal games.</p>
        <br> <p>Ujjwal has studied till 12th standard and maybe he completes his graduation in future. Ujjwal was also interested in technology. He also created a tech channel on YouTube named Ujjwal Chaurasia.

He then created his second YouTube channel on 13 August 2017, which he named “Techno Gamerz Official”, which was later changed to “Techno Gamerz”.

When he created this channel, he did not even have his own mobile. At the time, he used to play the game from his brother’s mobile and upload that gameplay to YouTube.

It was Ujjwal’s brother who advised Ujjwal to create a channel on YouTube. In the beginning, Ujjwal used to upload only recorded gameplay videos, due to which he was not getting more subscribers and views.

But gradually he understood everything and started voice over with his video. Now he was becoming successful and he started making videos with Face Cam.

Apart from this, on 20 January 2018, he made his second gaming channel, named “Ujjwal Gamer”, which later changed to “Ujjwal”. He uploads most of the videos of PUBG Mobile on this channel.</p>
